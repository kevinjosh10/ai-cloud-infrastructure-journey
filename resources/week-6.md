## 🧠 Key Learning Strategy

- Learn concept → Visualize → Practice → Debug  
- Use CLI tools daily  
- Break things intentionally and fix them  
- Always ask: “Why is this happening?”  

---

## 🔄 Mindset Shift

Moved from:

> Just reading networking concepts  

To:

> Using real tools to test, analyze, and debug network behavior
